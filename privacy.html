                        Welcome to the BATCommunity.org website (the “Site”) of Brave Software International. (“BSI”, “we”, “us” and/or
                        “our”). The site is operated by BSI, and is designed to provide information about the Basic
                        Attention Token, or BAT, as well as services related to BAT (together with the Site, the
                        “Services”) to our visitors (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with
                        respect to handling of personal data you submit to us (“Personal Data”) and other information
                        that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Information We Collect:</h5>
                        <br />
                        When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other
                        information from you, as described below:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong> We collect Personal Data
                        from you when you
                        voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to a
                        survey, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Company collects
                        Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in
                        accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you
                        acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to
                        servers managed by or on behalf of BSI.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Cookies:</strong> In operating the Services, we sometimes use a technology called
                        "cookies." A cookie is
                        a piece of information that a server hosting our Services sends to your browser when you access
                        the Services. Some of our Services set a cookie on your browser for the purposes of associating
                        your browser with a given period of application usage, or “session”. In all cases in which we
                        use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. We do not use
                        third-party cookies. On most web browsers, there is a way to turn cookies off, but some of our
                        Services require them to function correctly.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h5>
                        <br />
                        We use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
                        If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection
                        with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will
                        use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you
                        provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data
                        to provide you with access to such services. We may use this information to contact you in the
                        future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, if at any
                        time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name
                        deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h5>
                        <br />
                        We are not the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital
                        part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may
                        share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth
                        below:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Hosting, application, and service providers:</strong> As noted above, BSI, like many
                        other businesses,
                        makes use of other companies’ hosted services in the course of providing its Services. Examples
                        of such functions include wallet and token services, mailing list management, cloud storage,
                        and payment processing. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we
                        only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Company may disclose your Personal Data if required to do
                        so by law or in
                        the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, or to
                        act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the
                        public.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Your Choices:</h5>
                        <br />
                        You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any
                        Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Exclusions:</h5>
                        <br />
                        This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Company other than
                        Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any
                        unsolicited information you provide to Company through the Services or through any other means.
                        This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services,
                        such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other
                        unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information
                        shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Company shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose,
                        and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Children:</h5>
                        <br />
                        Company does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are
                        under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage
                        parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our
                        Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services
                        without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has
                        provided Personal Data to Company through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor
                        to delete that information from our databases.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Links to Other Web Sites:</h5>
                        <br />
                        This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web
                        sites not operated or controlled by Company (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and
                        procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services
                        do not imply that Company endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting
                        those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h5>Security:</h5>
                        <br />
                        We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss,
                        misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, not all
                        internet or email transmissions are secure. In particular, email sent to or from the Services
                        may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you
                        send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the
                        internet.

                        When registered and posting, we record the IP address that the post originated from. We also
                        may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server. We retain
                        server logs on Discourse that contain the IP address of all server requests for no more than 90
                        days. We retain the IP addresses associated with registered users and their posts no more than
                        5 years.
